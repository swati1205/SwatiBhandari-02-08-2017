1. To establish a connection in two or different servers to pass parameters in Jenkins job hosted on two servers.

--> We can use Jenkins Api from curl command and execute the curl command in "Execute Windows Batch" build step.

  curl -X POST -u admin:admin "http://{Jenkins_url}/jenkins/job/{Job_Name}/buildWithParameters?version=StudentEnrollmentWithSpring-01.war"

Running this would run the job hosted on other jenkins server along with parameters upstream/downstream withoud master/slave connection between two servers.
